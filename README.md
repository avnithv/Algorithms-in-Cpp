# Algorithms in C++

This contains some templates, data structures, and algorithms in C++ designed for competitive programming.

This also has some solutions for some problems in coding competitions using these algorithms.

### Pros of C++:
- It's fast, which is useful in coding competitions with time restraints
- All the pro programmers use it

### Cons of C++:
- It's not Python; it's quite complicated but atleast it's better than Java.
